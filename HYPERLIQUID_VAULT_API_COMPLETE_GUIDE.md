# üè¶ HYPERLIQUID VAULT API - COMPLETE GUIDE

## üéØ YOUR KEY QUESTIONS ANSWERED

### 1. ‚ùå Do you need money in the leader wallet?
**NO!** You don't need trading capital in the leader wallet.
- Leader wallet only needs tiny amounts for L1 gas (if any)
- All trading capital stays in the vault ($100)
- Leader is just the "signing key" not the "money holder"

### 2. ‚úÖ Will trades show in the vault?
**YES!** All trades and positions appear in the vault, NOT in the leader wallet.
- When you trade, positions appear in vault account
- P&L accumulates in vault balance
- Leader wallet shows no positions or P&L

### 3. üîç How the Architecture Works

```
LEADER WALLET (0x8B25b3c7...)     VAULT (0xf22e1753...)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Balance: $16.38               ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Balance: $100.00
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Positions: NONE               ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Positions: ALL HERE
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Role: Signs trades            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Role: Holds capital
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Private Key: YOU HAVE         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Private Key: HYPERLIQUID HAS
```

**The Flow:**
1. Your algo uses leader's private key to sign
2. But queries vault for balance/positions
3. Trades execute using vault's capital
4. Positions appear in vault
5. P&L affects vault balance

## üìä VAULT API ENDPOINTS - WHAT YOU CAN DO

### ‚úÖ QUERIES (No Private Key Needed - Anyone Can Query)

#### 1. **Get Vault Balance & Margin**
```python
vault_state = info.user_state("0xf22e1753a0208a42fc60eae6a26218c5dfdaa5b0")
balance = float(vault_state["marginSummary"]["accountValue"])
```
Returns:
- `accountValue`: Total vault equity ($100)
- `totalMarginUsed`: Margin used for positions
- `totalNtlPos`: Total notional position
- `totalRawUsd`: Raw USD balance

#### 2. **Get Vault Positions**
```python
positions = vault_state["assetPositions"]
for pos in positions:
    if float(pos["position"]["szi"]) != 0:
        print(f"{pos['position']['coin']}: {pos['position']['szi']}")
```
Returns for each position:
- `coin`: Asset (e.g., "ADA")
- `szi`: Position size
- `entryPx`: Entry price
- `unrealizedPnl`: Current P&L
- `returnOnEquity`: ROE percentage

#### 3. **Get Vault Open Orders**
```python
vault_orders = info.open_orders("0xf22e1753a0208a42fc60eae6a26218c5dfdaa5b0")
```
Returns all pending orders in vault

#### 4. **Get Vault Trade History**
```python
vault_fills = info.user_fills("0xf22e1753a0208a42fc60eae6a26218c5dfdaa5b0")
```
Returns recent fills/trades

#### 5. **Get Vault Funding History**
```python
funding = info.user_funding("0xf22e1753a0208a42fc60eae6a26218c5dfdaa5b0")
```
Returns funding payments for perpetuals

### ‚úÖ TRADING OPERATIONS (Leader Private Key Required)

#### 1. **Place Orders (Affects Vault)**
```python
# YOU sign with leader key, but trade affects VAULT
exchange = Exchange(leader_account, base_url="https://api.hyperliquid.xyz")
order = exchange.order(
    name="ADA",
    is_buy=True,
    sz=100.0,  # Uses vault's $100, not leader's $16
    limit_px=0.87,
    order_type={"limit": {"tif": "Ioc"}}
)
```

#### 2. **Cancel Orders (In Vault)**
```python
# Cancel vault's orders using leader's signature
exchange.cancel(name="ADA", oid=order_id)
```

#### 3. **Modify Orders**
```python
exchange.modify_order(
    oid=order_id,
    name="ADA",
    is_buy=True,
    sz=100.0,
    limit_px=0.88
)
```

#### 4. **Update Leverage**
```python
exchange.update_leverage(
    name="ADA",
    leverage=5,
    is_cross=True  # Cross margin mode
)
```

---

### ‚ùå WHAT YOU CANNOT DO VIA API

These require Hyperliquid UI or special permissions:

1. **Withdraw from Vault** - Must use Hyperliquid UI
2. **Change Vault Parameters** - Management fee, performance fee, etc.
3. **Accept/Reject Depositors** - If vault has restrictions
4. **Transfer Vault Leadership** - Cannot change who controls vault
5. **Access Vault Private Key** - Hyperliquid controls this
6. **Direct Vault Creation** - Must use UI to create new vaults

---

## üîÑ PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Check Vault Health
```python
from hyperliquid.info import Info

info = Info(base_url="https://api.hyperliquid.xyz")
vault = "0xf22e1753a0208a42fc60eae6a26218c5dfdaa5b0"

# Get everything about vault
state = info.user_state(vault)

print(f"Balance: ${state['marginSummary']['accountValue']}")
print(f"Positions: {len([p for p in state['assetPositions'] if float(p['position']['szi']) != 0])}")
print(f"Open Orders: {len(info.open_orders(vault) or [])}")
```

### Example 2: Monitor Vault P&L
```python
# Track vault performance
initial_balance = 100.0  # What you started with
current = float(info.user_state(vault)['marginSummary']['accountValue'])
pnl = current - initial_balance
roi = (pnl / initial_balance) * 100

print(f"Vault P&L: ${pnl:.2f} ({roi:.2f}%)")
```

### Example 3: Trade with Vault Capital
```python
from eth_account import Account
from hyperliquid.exchange import Exchange

# Use LEADER key to trade VAULT capital
leader_key = "your_private_key"
account = Account.from_key(leader_key)
exchange = Exchange(account, base_url="https://api.hyperliquid.xyz")

# This trade uses vault's $100, not leader's $16
order = exchange.order(
    name="ADA",
    is_buy=True,
    sz=100.0,  # Can trade up to vault balance
    limit_px=0.87,
    order_type={"limit": {"tif": "Ioc"}}
)

# Position appears in VAULT, not leader
```

## üìà VAULT MONITORING ENDPOINTS

### For Your Dashboard/Monitoring:

```python
def get_vault_metrics():
    vault = "0xf22e1753a0208a42fc60eae6a26218c5dfdaa5b0"
    state = info.user_state(vault)
    
    return {
        "balance": float(state['marginSummary']['accountValue']),
        "positions": [{
            "coin": p['position']['coin'],
            "size": float(p['position']['szi']),
            "entry": float(p['position']['entryPx']),
            "pnl": float(p['position']['unrealizedPnl'])
        } for p in state['assetPositions'] if float(p['position']['szi']) != 0],
        "open_orders": len(info.open_orders(vault) or []),
        "margin_used": float(state['marginSummary']['totalMarginUsed']),
        "account_leverage": float(state['marginSummary']['accountLeverage'])
    }
```

## üéØ KEY INSIGHTS

### The Vault Model is PERFECT for Your Use Case:

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Leader: Just signs (needs minimal balance)
   - Vault: Holds capital and positions
   - Clean separation between control and capital

2. **Security**
   - Your private key never touches vault funds directly
   - Vault is isolated from your personal trading
   - Clear audit trail

3. **Scalability**
   - Vault can grow to millions without affecting leader
   - Other users can deposit without touching your wallet
   - Performance tracked independently

4. **The Money Flow**
   ```
   Depositors ‚Üí VAULT ($100+) ‚Üí Your Algo Trades ‚Üí P&L in VAULT
                  ‚Üë
            Leader just signs
           (doesn't need money)
   ```

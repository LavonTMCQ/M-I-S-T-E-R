## 🎯 Next Steps for Tonight/Tomorrow

### ✅ Phase 1: Contract Compilation (COMPLETE)
```bash
cd sydney-agents/mister-frontend
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox  ✅
npx hardhat init  # Create hardhat.config.js                     ✅
npx hardhat compile  # Compile AIAgentVault.sol contracts        ✅
```

**Achievements:**
- All 3 smart contracts compiled successfully

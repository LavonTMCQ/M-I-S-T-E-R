# Legacy Smart Contracts - Preserved Code Archive

This directory contains all the smart contract functionality that was developed for the MRSTRIKE project before transitioning to the simplified signal provider architecture. **All code here is fully functional and can be reintegrated when needed.**

## üéØ Purpose of This Archive

During our architectural analysis, we determined that the smart contract approach, while technically sound, was creating unnecessary complexity for the core goal of automated trading signals. Rather than delete this valuable work, we've preserved it here for future integration.

## üîÑ Reintegration Strategy

### Phase 1: Signal Provider (Current)
- Simple wallet connection for user identification
- Direct Strike Finance API integration
- Discord notifications for signals
- One-click execution without smart contracts

### Phase 2: Hybrid Approach (Future)
- Keep signal provider for immediate execution
- Add Agent Vault option for automated trading
- Users choose between manual signals or automated vault trading
- Preserve both architectures

### Phase 3: Full Smart Contract Integration (Advanced)
- Reintegrate all Agent Vault functionality
- Add Vespr wallet integration back to main app
- Enable complex automated trading strategies
- Multi-vault support and advanced features

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Integration Notes

### Dependencies Required for Reintegration
```bash
# Cardano Serialization Library
npm install @emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib-browser

# Additional Cardano utilities
npm install @blockfrost/openapi
npm install cbor
```

### Environment Variables Needed
```env
# Blockfrost API (for Cardano blockchain access)
BLOCKFROST_PROJECT_ID=mainnetKDR7gGfvHy85Mqr4nYtfjoXq7fX8R1Bu
BLOCKFROST_PROJECT_ID_TESTNET=testnetYourProjectId

# Cardano network configuration
CARDANO_NETWORK=mainnet
```

### Key Integration Points

1. **Wallet Context**: The existing wallet context in `/src/contexts/WalletContext.tsx` can be extended to include smart contract functionality

2. **API Routes**: The preserved API routes can be moved back to `/src/app/api/cardano/` when needed

3. **Components**: The Agent Vault components can be integrated into the main component library

4. **Services**: The Mastra services can be reactivated in the main services directory

## üîí Security Considerations

- All smart contracts use proper validation and security measures
- Withdrawal mechanisms are tested and functional
- User funds are protected with proper access controls

### Transaction Security
- All transactions use CSL for secure CBOR generation
- Proper UTxO selection and change calculation
- Fee estimation and validation included

   ```

4. **Add Test Pages**:
   ```bash
   mv /legacy-smart-contracts/test-pages/* /src/app/
   ```

5. **Update Dependencies**: Install required Cardano packages

6. **Configure Environment**: Add Blockfrost and Cardano environment variables

## üìù Conclusion

# ðŸ”¥ NUCLEAR RECOVERY OPTION - FUCK VESPR

Since Vespr is being a piece of shit and greying out transactions no matter what we do, here are your **ACTUAL** working options:

## Option 1: Use Eternl Wallet Instead
Eternl has better transaction support and doesn't grey out as much as Vespr.

1. Install Eternl wallet
2. Import your seed phrase
3. Use the exact same recovery tool but connect Eternl instead of Vespr

## Option 2: Use Yoroi Wallet 
Yoroi is more stable for transaction signing.

1. Install Yoroi
2. Import your seed phrase  
3. Use recovery tool with Yoroi

## Option 3: CLI Recovery (100% GUARANTEED TO WORK)
Fuck browser wallets entirely. Use cardano-cli:

```bash
# 1. Build the transaction with cardano-cli
cardano-cli transaction build \
    --tx-in 56882b32f6a1ff9963bc67c3cf8270644fd84ed32989408c9933e735cf6702fb:0 \
    --tx-out addr1qxtkdjl87894tg6juz20jzyjqy3uyn02pr9xtq7mlh0gm2ss5dpkcny95dktp5qmyyrx82t68sge4m94qwxyrfr8f86qh5unyc+4500000 \
    --change-address addr1qxtkdjl87894tg6juz20jzyjqy3uyn02pr9xtq7mlh0gm2ss5dpkcny95dktp5qmyyrx82t68sge4m94qwxyrfr8f86qh5unyc \
    --mainnet \
    --out-file recovery.raw

# 2. Sign with your wallet
cardano-cli transaction sign \
    --tx-body-file recovery.raw \
    --signing-key-file payment.skey \
    --mainnet \
    --out-file recovery.signed

# 3. Submit
cardano-cli transaction submit \
    --tx-file recovery.signed \
    --mainnet
```

## Option 4: Use Eternl Web Interface Directly
1. Go to eternl.io 
2. Connect wallet
3. Go to "Advanced" â†’ "Sign Transaction"
4. Paste the CBOR directly
5. Sign and submit

## Option 5: Ask Someone Else To Help
Post on Cardano Discord/Reddit with your CBOR and ask someone with a working wallet to sign it for you (obviously risky but desperate times).

## Option 6: Wait For Vespr Update
Vespr might be fucked due to a version issue. Wait for them to fix their shit.

## THE REAL PROBLEM
The issue isn't our code - it's that Vespr wallet is garbage for complex transactions. Your smart contracts are fine, the CBOR is fine, but Vespr just sucks.

## RECOMMENDATION
**Use Eternl wallet**. It's way better than Vespr for this kind of thing.

1. Install Eternl
2. Import your wallet
3. Use `http://localhost:3000/recovery.html` 
4. Click "Connect Eternl" instead of Vespr
5. It should work properly

Vespr is just being a piece of shit. Don't waste more time on it.

# ✅ VAULT FIX DEPLOYED - January 28, 2025

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STATUS
- **Commit Hash**: d759837
- **Pushed At**: Just now
- **Railway Deploy**: Auto-deploying (2-3 minutes)
- **Production URL**: https://misterlabs220-production.up.railway.app

## 🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED

### The Problem:
- Algorithm was querying leader wallet: **$16.37**
- Should be querying vault: **$100.00**
- Result: Only using 16% of available capital

### The Solution:
Added vault address and updated balance/position queries:

```python
# Added to __init__:
self.vault_address = "0xf22e1753a0208a42fc60eae6a26218c5dfdaa5b0"

# Updated get_account_value():
user_state = self.info.user_state(self.vault_address)  # Was self.address

# Updated get_position():
user_state = self.info.user_state(self.vault_address)  # Was self.address
```

## 📊 EXPECTED RESULTS

### Before Fix:
```json
{
  "balance": 16.366968,  // ❌ Leader wallet
  "position": null
}
```

### After Fix (Expected):
```json
{
  "balance": 100.00,  // ✅ Vault balance
  "position": null     // Or vault positions
}
```

## 🔍 HOW TO VERIFY (After Deploy)

Check the account endpoint:
```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: mister_labs_220_tQm8Kx9pL3nR7vB2" \
  https://misterlabs220-production.up.railway.app/account
```

Should return:
- `balance`: ~100.00 (not 16.37)

## 🎯 IMPACT

**This fix enables:**
- 6x larger position sizes
- Proper vault capital utilization
- Correct risk management calculations
- Accurate position tracking in vault

## 📈 TRADING MECHANICS

The system now works correctly:
1. **Leader wallet** (0x8B25b3c7...) - Signs transactions with private key
2. **Vault** (0xf22e1753...) - Holds funds ($100) and positions
3. **Algorithm** - Queries vault for state, uses leader for signing

## ⏰ TIMELINE

1. ✅ **DONE** - Code fixed and pushed to GitHub
2. ⏳ **IN PROGRESS** - Railway auto-deploying (2-3 mins)
3. 🔜 **NEXT** - Verify balance shows $100
4. 🔜 **THEN** - Algorithm will trade with full vault capital

## 🚨 MONITORING

After deployment completes, the algorithm will:
- Report $100 balance instead of $16
- Calculate positions based on vault equity
- Place larger trades (6x current size)
- Track positions in vault account

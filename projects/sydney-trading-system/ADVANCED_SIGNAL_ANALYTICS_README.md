## 🔧 Integration

### TradingView Chart Integration
The analytics system is fully integrated with the TradingView chart component:

```typescript
// Automatic signal tracking
signals.forEach(signal => {
  const signalId = signalAnalyticsService.addSignal(signal);
  signal.id = signalId;
});

// Real-time quality assessment
<SignalQualityIndicator signal={latestSignal} />
```

### Data Flow
1. **Signal Generation**: MACD service generates signals
2. **Analytics Tracking**: Signals automatically added to analytics service
3. **Quality Scoring**: Real-time quality assessment
4. **Performance Tracking**: Exit data updates for completed signals
5. **Dashboard Display**: Real-time analytics updates

## 📊 Usage Examples

### Basic Analytics Query
```typescript
import { signalAnalyticsService } from '@/services/signalAnalyticsService';

// Get overall analytics
const analytics = signalAnalyticsService.calculateAnalytics();
console.log(`Win Rate: ${analytics.winRate.toFixed(1)}%`);
console.log(`Profit Factor: ${analytics.profitFactor.toFixed(2)}`);

// Filter for recent signals
const recentAnalytics = signalAnalyticsService.calculateAnalytics({
  dateRange: {
    start: new Date(Date.now() - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // Last 7 days
    end: new Date()
  }
});
```

### Signal Quality Assessment
```typescript
// Assess signal quality
const qualityScore = signalAnalyticsService.calculateSignalQualityScore(signal);
if (qualityScore > 0.7) {
  console.log('High quality signal - consider taking');
} else if (qualityScore < 0.4) {
  console.log('Low quality signal - consider avoiding');
}
```

### Performance Filtering
```typescript
// Get only winning LONG signals with high confidence
const winningLongs = signalAnalyticsService.getSignalHistory({
  type: 'long',
  outcome: 'win',
  minConfidence: 600
});
```

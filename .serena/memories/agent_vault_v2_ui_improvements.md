# Agent Vault V2 UI Improvements and Architecture (January 2025)

## Overview
The Agent Vault V2 represents a significant architectural and user experience upgrade to the vault management system, focusing on user-friendly multi-vault support, robust wallet integration, and improved state management.

## 1. Multi-Vault Limit System

### Key Constraints
- **Maximum Vaults**: Strictly limited to 2 vaults per user
- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - Vault count display: "(1/2) â†’ (2/2)"
  - "Maximum 2 Vaults Reached" messaging
- **Generate Button Behavior**: 
  - Progressively disables when vault limit is reached
  - Dynamic UI state reflecting vault creation status

### LocalStorage Architecture
```javascript
// Vault Storage Structure
{
  'mister-user-vaults': [
    {
      id: 'vault_timestamp',         // Unique identifier
      name: 'Vault 1',               // User-friendly name
      credentials: {                 // Secure vault credentials
        address: string,
        seed: string,
        // Other necessary credential information
      },
      isActive: boolean,             // Currently selected vault
      balance: number,               // Current vault balance
      createdAt: ISO_string,         // Creation timestamp
      network: 'mainnet' | 'testnet' // Network configuration
    }
    // Up to 2 vault objects allowed
  ],
  'mister-current-vault-id': 'vault_id'  // Currently active vault reference
}
```

## 2. Wallet Integration Improvements

### Wallet Detection and Integration
- **Supported Wallets**: 
  - Eternl
  - Nami
  - Vespr
  - Other CIP-30 compatible wallets
- **Dynamic Connection**:
  - Detects connected wallet type
  - Adapts UI to show connected wallet
  - Example button text: "Fund Vault with ETERNL (5 ADA)"

### Wallet Connection Challenges
- Varying UTXO structures across different wallets
- Inconsistent transaction building APIs
- Need for a standardized transaction construction approach

## 3. State Management Architecture

### Key State Management Principles
- Persistent vault state across page refreshes
- Automatic vault switching
- Secure credential management
- Comprehensive error handling

### State Transition Flows
1. **Vault Creation**
   - Generate new vault credentials
   - Add to `mister-user-vaults`
   - Set as active vault
   - Update localStorage

2. **Vault Switching**
   - Update `mister-current-vault-id`
   - Refresh UI with new vault details
   - Validate wallet connection

3. **Vault Deletion**
   - Remove from `mister-user-vaults`
   - Switch to another vault if available
   - Clean up related localStorage entries

## 4. Transaction Building Challenges

### Current Limitations
- Wallet API inconsistencies
- WASM/Next.js compatibility issues
- Complex UTXO management

### Recommended Architecture
1. **Server-Side Transaction Building**
   - Implement robust CBOR transaction construction in Cardano service
   - Standardize transaction format across wallet types
   - Provide fallback mechanisms for different wallet APIs

2. **Client-Side Validation**
   - Perform pre-flight checks on transaction feasibility
   - Validate balance and wallet connectivity
   - Provide clear error messaging

## 5. UX Enhancement Strategies

### Visual Indicators
- Colored badges for vault status
- Hover effects on vault cards
- Progressive disclosure of vault actions
- Clear limit messaging: "Your Vaults (X/2)"

### Interaction Patterns
- Confirmation dialogs for critical actions
- Smooth transitions between vault states
- Informative tooltips for user guidance

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Transaction Reliability**
   - Develop comprehensive transaction builder in Cardano service
   - Implement thorough error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Create wallet adapter for consistent API

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Implement secure credential encryption
   - Add vault-level access controls
   - Develop backup and recovery mechanisms

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Minimize localStorage operations
   - Implement efficient state synchronization
   - Reduce unnecessary re-renders

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Comprehensive wallet integration tests
   - Multi-wallet scenario validation
   - Performance and security audits

## Technical Debt and Potential Improvements
- Standardize wallet connection protocols
- Develop a universal transaction builder
- Implement more granular vault permissions
- Create advanced vault management features

## Conclusion
The Agent Vault V2 UI represents a significant step towards a more user-friendly, flexible, and robust vault management system. By addressing key challenges in wallet integration, state management, and user experience, we've laid a strong foundation for future enhancements.

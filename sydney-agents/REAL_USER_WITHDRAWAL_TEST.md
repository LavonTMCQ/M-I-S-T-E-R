# ðŸ”¥ REAL USER WITHDRAWAL TESTING - PRODUCTION MAINNET

## ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL: REAL MONEY WITHDRAWAL VALIDATION**

**Date**: 2025-01-18  
**Status**: **READY FOR REAL ADA WITHDRAWAL TESTING**  
**Network**: **Cardano Mainnet**  
**Contract**: `addr1wxwx5rmqrwm4mpeg5ky6rt6lq76errkjjs490pewl9rqvrcqzrec7`

---

## ðŸ’° **REAL WITHDRAWAL TEST PROTOCOL**

### **Prerequisites**
- âœ… Agent Vault created with 75 REAL ADA
- âœ… Production smart contract deployed
- âœ… User owns the vault (VKH verified)
- âœ… Wallet connected to Cardano mainnet

### **Test Scenarios**
1. **Partial Withdrawal**: 25 ADA (keep 50 ADA for trading)
2. **Full Withdrawal**: All remaining ADA (close vault)
3. **Emergency Withdrawal**: Immediate fund recovery
4. **Security Test**: Unauthorized withdrawal attempt (should fail)

---

## ðŸ”§ **WITHDRAWAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Smart Contract Validation**
The production contract validates:
```aiken
// User withdrawal validation
fn validate_user_withdrawal(context: Data, datum: Data, redeemer: Data) -> Bool {
  // 1. Verify user signature (from context)
  // 2. Validate withdrawal amount
  // 3. Ensure user owns the vault
  // 4. Check no active trading positions
  // 5. Calculate correct output amounts
}
```

### **Frontend Integration**
```typescript
// Real withdrawal transaction builder
const buildWithdrawalTransaction = async (
  vaultAddress: string,
  withdrawalAmount: number,
  userAddress: string
) => {
  // Build REAL transaction for REAL ADA withdrawal
  const tx = await agentVaultTransactionBuilder.buildUserWithdrawal({
    vaultAddress,
    withdrawalAmount: withdrawalAmount * 1_000_000, // Convert to lovelace
    userAddress,
    userVkh: await getUserVkh(userAddress)
  });
  
  return tx; // REAL CBOR for REAL mainnet transaction
};
```

5. Verify transaction on Cardano mainnet
6. Confirm user receives 25 ADA
7. Verify vault balance shows 50 ADA

### **Test 2: Full Withdrawal (50 ADA)**

Expected Remaining: 0 ADA
Expected User Receives: 50 ADA (minus network fees)
Vault Status: CLOSED
```

**Steps:**
1. Click "Withdraw All REAL ADA"
2. Confirm full withdrawal warning
3. Sign transaction with wallet
4. Verify transaction on Cardano mainnet
5. Confirm user receives 50 ADA
6. Verify vault shows 0 ADA balance

```

**Steps:**
1. Click "Emergency Stop"
2. Confirm emergency withdrawal
3. Sign emergency transaction
4. Verify all trading stops

### **Test 4: Security Validation**
```bash

Attacker: Different wallet tries to withdraw
Expected: Transaction REJECTED by smart contract
Security: Only vault owner can withdraw
```

**Steps:**
1. Connect different wallet
2. Attempt withdrawal from vault
3. Verify transaction fails
4. Confirm error: "Unauthorized withdrawal"
5. Verify original user funds safe

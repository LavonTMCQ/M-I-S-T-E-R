Final Recommendation: Micro-Optimizations Only

Based on extensive testing, our algorithm works well (62.5% win rate, 43.9 ADA profit).
Instead of major changes, apply tiny optimizations that respect the 15-minute timeframe.

Key insight: We've hit the practical limit of what's achievable with 15-minute data.
The algorithm is already well-optimized for ADA's behavior.

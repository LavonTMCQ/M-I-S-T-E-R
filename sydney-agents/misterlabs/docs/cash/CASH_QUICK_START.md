### Getting Market Overview
```
User: "What's the current market sentiment?"

CASH: "Let me check both traditional and crypto markets for you...

üìà **Traditional Markets (via MRS):**
- S&P 500 showing bullish momentum
- Tech sector leading gains
- Low volatility environment

‚Çø **Crypto Markets (via MISTER):**
- Bitcoin consolidating above key support
- Cardano ecosystem showing development activity
- DeFi protocols gaining traction

**Overall Sentiment**: Cautiously optimistic with opportunities in both sectors."
```

### Portfolio Analysis
```
User: "Analyze my portfolio: 40% AAPL, 30% BTC, 20% SPY, 10% ADA"

CASH: "Analyzing your mixed portfolio across traditional and crypto assets...

**Portfolio Breakdown:**
- Traditional: 60% (AAPL 40%, SPY 20%)
- Cryptocurrency: 40% (BTC 30%, ADA 10%)

**Risk Assessment:**
- Moderate to high risk due to crypto allocation
- Good diversification between growth (AAPL) and broad market (SPY)
- Crypto portion well-balanced between established (BTC) and emerging (ADA)

**Recommendations:**
- Consider adding some defensive positions
- Monitor correlation between AAPL and BTC during market stress
- ADA allocation appropriate for Cardano ecosystem exposure"

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**CASH Agent Not Found**
```bash
# Check if server is running
curl http://localhost:4112/api/agents
# Look for "cashAgent" in the response
```

**MRS/MISTER Connectivity Issues**
```bash
# Test MRS agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:4111/api/agents/MRSAgent/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Test"}],"resourceId":"test","threadId":"test"}'

# Test MISTER agent  
curl -X POST http://localhost:4111/api/agents/MISTERAgent/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Test"}],"resourceId":"test","threadId":"test"}'
```

**Slow Response Times**

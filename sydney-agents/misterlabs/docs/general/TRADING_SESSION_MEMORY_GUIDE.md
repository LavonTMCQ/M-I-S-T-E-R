## üìä Market Session Awareness

### **Trading Sessions**
Sone automatically detects and adjusts for:

- **Pre-Market** (4:00-9:30 AM): Lower volume, news reactions
- **Market Open** (9:30-10:30 AM): High volume, institutional activity
- **Mid-Day** (10:30 AM-3:00 PM): Lower volume, range-bound
- **Power Hour** (3:00-4:00 PM): Increased volume, trend continuation
- **After-Hours** (4:00-8:00 PM): News reactions, earnings

### **Session-Specific Analysis**
- **Pre-Market**: Gap analysis, overnight news impact
- **Open**: Breakout potential, institutional flows
- **Mid-Day**: Range trading, consolidation patterns
- **Power Hour**: Trend confirmation, closing strength
- **After-Hours**: Extended moves, earnings reactions

## üîÑ Progressive Analysis Workflow

### **First Analysis of the Day**
1. **Establish Baseline**: Key levels, trend direction, pattern setup
2. **Multi-Timeframe Context**: Higher timeframe bias and levels
3. **Session Memory**: Store initial observations
4. **MRS Consultation**: Current market conditions and news

### **Subsequent Analysis (Every 3 Minutes)**
1. **Compare with Previous**: How has price action evolved?
2. **Pattern Development**: Are patterns completing or failing?
3. **Level Reactions**: How is price reacting to key levels?
4. **Trend Progression**: Is trend strengthening or weakening?
5. **Update Memory**: Store new observations and changes

### **Analysis Progression Example**
```
9:35 AM - First Analysis:
"SPY testing resistance at 450, forming ascending triangle on 3m, 
1h shows uptrend, daily at key resistance"

9:38 AM - Second Analysis:
"SPY broke above 450 resistance with volume, triangle breakout confirmed,
1h momentum increasing, daily breakout attempt in progress"

9:41 AM - Third Analysis:
"SPY holding above 450, pullback to retest breakout level,
volume declining on pullback (healthy), 1h still bullish"
```

## üéØ Multi-Timeframe Strategy

### **Timeframe Hierarchy**
1. **Daily (1d)**: Overall trend direction and major levels
2. **Hourly (1h)**: Intermediate trend and swing levels

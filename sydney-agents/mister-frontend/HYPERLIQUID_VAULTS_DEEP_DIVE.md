# 🏦 HYPERLIQUID VAULTS: Complete Deep Dive

## 📊 What Are Hyperliquid Vaults?

Hyperliquid vaults are **on-chain copy-trading systems** built directly into the L1. They allow traders (leaders) to manage capital from investors (depositors/followers) without custody - the funds always remain under the protocol's control.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

### Two Types of Vaults:

1. **User Vaults** (What You'll Create)
   - Created by individual traders
   - Minimum creation: 100 USDC deposit
   - Creation fee: 100 USDC (goes to protocol)
   - Leader must maintain ≥5% ownership
   - 1-day withdrawal lock-up for depositors

2. **Protocol Vaults** (HLP)
   - Hyperliquidity Provider (HLP)
   - Market making and liquidations
   - No fees or profit share
   - 4-day withdrawal lock-up
   - Receives portion of trading fees

## 💰 How Vaults Actually Work

### The Flow:
```
1. Leader creates vault (100 USDC min + 100 USDC fee)
2. Depositors add USDC to vault
3. Leader trades with combined capital
4. All positions are proportionally owned
5. Profits/losses shared proportionally
6. Leader gets 10% of profits on withdrawal
```

### Key Mechanics:
- **Non-custodial**: Leader CANNOT withdraw depositor funds
- **Proportional**: Each depositor owns a % of all positions
- **Transparent**: All trades visible on-chain
- **Permissionless**: Anyone can create/join vaults

## 👥 Leader Requirements & Benefits

### Requirements:
- **Minimum Stake**: Must maintain ≥5% of vault at all times
- **Initial Deposit**: 100 USDC minimum
- **Creation Fee**: 100 USDC (one-time)
- **Skin in the Game**: Cannot withdraw below 5% threshold

### Benefits:
- **Performance Fee**: 10% of all profits
- **No Management Fee**: Only earn on performance
- **Scale Capital**: Trade with more than your own funds
- **Build Reputation**: On-chain track record

### Example:
```python
# Vault with $10,000 from depositors
# Leader owns 5% ($500)
# Vault makes 100% profit ($10,000 profit)
# Leader receives:
#   - Their share: 5% of $10,000 = $500
#   - Performance fee: 10% of $9,500 = $950
#   - Total: $1,450 (190% return on $500)
```

## 💸 Depositor Experience

### How to Deposit:
1. Go to https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/vaults

- **Withdrawal Rights**: Can exit after 1-day lock-up
- **Transparency**: See all trades and performance

## 🔄 Position Management

### How Positions Work:
```python
# Example Vault:
# Total: $100,000 USDC
# Leader: $5,000 (5%)
# Depositor A: $50,000 (50%)
# Depositor B: $45,000 (45%)

# Leader opens 1000 ADA long at $1.00
# Position ownership:
# - Leader: 50 ADA (5%)
# - Depositor A: 500 ADA (50%)
# - Depositor B: 450 ADA (45%)
```

### On Withdrawals:
- **Sufficient Margin**: Positions stay open
- **Insufficient Margin**: Proportional close
- Example: 10% withdrawal = 10% of all positions closed

## 💵 Commission Structure

### The 10% Performance Fee:
```python
# Scenario: Depositor invests $1,000
# Vault performance: +20% ($200 profit)
# On withdrawal:
#   - Depositor receives: $1,180 (principal + 90% of profit)
#   - Leader receives: $20 (10% of $200 profit)
```

### When Commissions Are Paid:
- **Only on withdrawal**: Not taken continuously
- **Only on profits**: No fee if no profit
- **From depositor's profit**: Not from principal
- **Automatic**: Protocol handles distribution

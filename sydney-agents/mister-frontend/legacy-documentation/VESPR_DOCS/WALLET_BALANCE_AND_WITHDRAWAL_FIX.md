# 🔧 WALLET BALANCE & WITHDRAWAL ADDRESS FIXES

## 🚨 **ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### **Issue 1: Wallet Balance Shows 0.00 ADA**
- UI displays `0.00 ADA` even though wallet has funds
- Balance API is working but not refreshing in UI

### **Issue 2: Withdrawal Address Corruption**
- Address corrupted from `...h5unyc` to `...h5unye` during withdrawal
- Blockfrost rejects with "Invalid address" error
- Address normalization is corrupting the address

## ✅ **COMPLETE FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **Fix 1: Force Wallet Balance Refresh**
**File**: `src/components/agent-vault-v2.tsx`

```typescript
// ✅ Added wallet balance refresh to loadVaultState
const loadVaultState = async () => {
  // ... existing vault state loading ...
  
  // Also refresh wallet balance
  console.log('🔄 Refreshing wallet balance...');
  await refreshWalletData(); // ✅ Force wallet balance refresh
};
```

**Result**: 
- Manual "Refresh Balance" button now refreshes both vault AND wallet balance
- Auto-refresh after transactions updates both balances
- Wallet balance should display correctly

### **Fix 2: Bypass Address Normalization for Withdrawals**
**File**: `src/services/simple-transaction-service.ts`

```typescript
// ❌ OLD CODE (Address Normalization - CORRUPTS ADDRESS)
const addresses = await walletApi.getUsedAddresses();
recipientAddress = await this.ensureBech32Address(addresses[0]); // CORRUPTS!

// ✅ NEW CODE (Use Raw Address Directly)
const addresses = await walletApi.getUsedAddresses();
recipientAddress = addresses[0]; // Use raw address directly - NO NORMALIZATION

// Validate it's proper bech32 format
if (!recipientAddress.startsWith('addr1')) {
  throw new Error('Address is not in bech32 format');
}
```

**Result**:
- Withdrawal uses the **exact same address format** as the wallet API provides
- No address corruption through normalization
- Address remains `...h5unyc` instead of corrupting to `...h5unye`

## 🎯 **WHY THESE FIXES WORK**

### **Wallet Balance Fix**
- The balance API works correctly
- The issue was that the UI wasn't refreshing the wallet context after transactions
- Now both vault balance AND wallet balance refresh together

### **Withdrawal Address Fix**
- **Root Cause**: The `ensureBech32Address()` normalization was corrupting addresses
- **Solution**: Skip normalization entirely for withdrawals
- **Logic**: Wallet API already returns correct bech32 format, no conversion needed
- **Validation**: Still check that address starts with `addr1` for safety

## 🧪 **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR NOW**

### **Wallet Balance Display**
1. ✅ Should show actual wallet balance (not 0.00 ADA)
2. ✅ Refreshes when clicking "Refresh Balance" button
3. ✅ Auto-refreshes after successful transactions

### **Withdrawal Process**
1. ✅ Uses raw address from `walletApi.getUsedAddresses()[0]`
2. ✅ No address normalization/corruption
3. ✅ Address remains `...h5unyc` (correct format)
4. ✅ Blockfrost accepts the address
5. ✅ Transaction builds and submits successfully

### **Test Withdrawal**
1. Click "Withdraw" tab
2. Enter amount (e.g., 1 ADA)
3. Click "Withdraw ADA"
4. Should build transaction successfully
5. Vespr wallet should show correct withdrawal transaction
6. No "Invalid address" errors

**Both wallet balance display and withdrawal functionality should now work perfectly!** 🚀
